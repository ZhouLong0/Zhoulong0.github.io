Hi there! I'm a last year Master student at Politecnico di Milano, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ within the [Alliance4Tech](https://www.alliance4tech.eu) joint program in collaboration with TU Berlin and CentraleSupelÃ©c

During my Master's I've been a research intern at the [Center for Visual Computing lab](https://cvn.centralesupelec.fr), UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay - CentraleSupelÃ©c supervised by Prof. [Jean-Christophe Pesquet](http://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=0E9plnpntdkC&hl=en) and worked closely with Prof. [Ismail Ben Ayed](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=29vyUccAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Mounir Kaaniche](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DL6mUl8AAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of RomaTre with maximum grade in 2022.

My research interests include Few-Shot Learning, Vision-Language, Self-supervised Learning.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
